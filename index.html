<h1> Mozambique Scoping Update </h1>

<section>
	<h1>What are we doing in Mozambique?</h1>
	<p>Part of CPI's Production-Protection portfolio (with Brazil and Indonesia).</p>
 	<p>Supported by Barclays Africa in partnership with Technoserve.</p>
	<p>Initial focus on physical, economic, institutional, and social landscape.</p>
	<p>Now moving into project mode.</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Key Points:</h1>
	<ul>
		<li> Land use drives Mozambique's carbon emissions, climate risk, and low income.</li>
		<li> Most land is not cultivated. </li>
		<li> Cultivated land has low productivity. </li>
		<li> Uncultivated land is deforested for household fuel, especially near cities. </li>
		<li> The PP Framework will help us understand why. </li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>A brief history and mini-geography</h1>
	<div id = "mozmap" class = "box"></div>
	<div style = "float:right width:55%">
	<ul>
		<li> Portugal arrived 1498.</li>
		<li> Revolution began September 1964 (FRELIMO formed 1962).</li>
		<li> Independence June 25, 1975 (coup in Lisbon in 1974). </li>
		<li> Civil war begins in 1977. </li>
		<li> Civil war ends October 4, 1992 (talks began in 1990).</li>
		<li> First election in 1994. </li>

<h1>Land use drives Mozambique's emissions.</h1>
The 1994 GHG inventory shows the importance of agriculture and forestry.

<h1>Mozambican incomes are land-use driven.</h1>
Agriculture employs <strong>90%</strong> of women and 
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<strong>70%</strong> of men in Mozambique.
<br>
It represents <strong>24%</strong> of the country's GDP.
</section>

<section>
<h1>Climate risk is serious in Mozambique.</h1>
Mozambique is among the world's most at risk countries for droughts and flooding from climate change.
<br>
<br>
Flooding and droughts are increasing in frequency and severity.

	<h1>Even on cultivated land, productivity is low.</h1>

<section>
	<h1>Uncultivated land is deforested for fuel.</h1>
	Each year, <strong>529 square miles</strong> of land are deforested for fuel.
	<br>
	<strong>50%</strong> of the country remains forested.
	<br>
	The forest is shrinking <strong>0.5-1.5%</strong> each year.

<h1>Production-Protection</h1>
<div style = "text-align: center">
<img src="ppmatrix.png" width="40%"  alt="The Production-Protection Matrix" />
</div>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Barriers: Technology & Institutions</h1>
	<ul>
		<li> Less than 10% of farmers use improved seeds in maize, and closer to 3-4% for other crops.</li>
		<li> Fertilizer is expensive and rarely used. </li>
		<li> Less than 2% of irrigable land is irrigated. </li>
		<li> Less than 10% of farmers have access to extension services. </li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Land rights are difficult to obtain</h1>
	<img src="available.png" width = "95%" alt="Available land in Mozambique" />
	Only 7 million of estimated 32.4 million uncultivated arable hectares are considered "available."
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Barriers: Finance</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Only 20% of finance is in rural areas, despite the fact that 60% of the population lives there.</li>
		<li>Only 6% of total lending goes to agriculture.</li>
		<li>Interest rates for the loans that do exist are as high as 30%.</li>
		<li>However banks have money - current loan to debt ratio is only 50-55%.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Barriers: Risk Management</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Smallholder risk assessment is very difficult.</li>
		<li>Weather affects production and prices.</li>
		<li>Currency risk can increase the cost of finance.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Barriers: Markets & Infrastructure</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Energy production is massive, but it doesn't reach Mozambique's population (it goes to South Africa instead).</li>
		<li>Government aims to extend to grid to reach 15% of the population by 2015 and 20% by 2020. </li>
		<li>Limited access to electricity means irrigation, cooling, and processing are challenging.</li>
		<li>FUNAE is running a program to promote rural electrification (and CPI may be involved)</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h1>Next Steps</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Sugar cogeneration</li>
		<li>Smallholder business models </li>
		<li>Off-grid solar</li>
		<li>Investor mapping</li>
	</ul>
